## MohaDoro [![Built with open-wc recommendations](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-open--wc-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-wc)

A countdown timer built with Web Components.

For me it has always been difficult to focus on a single task. I've have found
very useful the podoro technique wich relays on time intervals so I decide to
create my own countdown timer.

This app was build with the only pourpouse to learn about web components,
practice time management using JavaScript and start using NeoVim.

## Quickstart

Be sure to have [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/es/) and npm installed before
start.

To get started:

```bash
npm install
# requires node 10 & npm 6 or higher
```

## Scripts

- `start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `lint` runs the linter for your project
- `format` fixes linting and formatting errors
